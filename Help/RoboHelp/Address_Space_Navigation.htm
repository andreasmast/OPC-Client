<h1>Browsing an Address Space using the Generic Client</h1>
<p>All OPC Servers provide the ability to navigate their address space. 
 The feature/functionality built into OPC UA enables users to define very 
 elaborate and information-rich content that can be consumed by any UA 
 client. The UA Sample Client contains leverages many of these features 
 allowing the user to navigate the address space with ease, while maintaining 
 maximum flexibility in the application of filtering.</p>
<p>The main Client window allows you to browse the address space with ease 
 with minimal information available. Simply expand/collapse a node to show/hide 
 the children beneath it.</p>
<h2>Context Menu</h2>
<p>The following context-menu exists for the node browser that occupies 
 the main area of the application:</p>
<p class="Picture"><img src="image54.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" 
						 border="0" /> or <img src="image60.gif" alt="" 
												 style="border: none;" 
												 border="0" /> or <img 
	 src="image61.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /></p>
<h3>Browse Options</h3>
<p class="Picture"><img src="image55.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" 
						 border="0" /></p>
<p>The options in this dialog allow you to precisely tune the exact types 
 of UA node(s) that you wish to see/exclude when browsing. The specific 
 fields within this dialog are not described as they are clearly documented 
 in <a href="http://www.opcfoundation.org/ua/part4"><?rh-udv_start name="UaSpec04" ?>UA Specifications Part 4 - Services (http://www.opcfoundation.org/ua/part4)<?rh-udv_end ?></a>.</p>
<p>Clicking the <span style="font-weight: bold;">OK</span> button will 
 immediately activate the filtration.</p>
<h3>Show References</h3>
<p class="Picture"><img src="image56.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" 
						 border="0" /></p>
<p>Toggling this option will change the navigation content to show either 
 the nodes as they are organized hierarchically, or will display them as 
 they are organized by reference(s). </p>
<h3>Browse</h3>
<p class="Picture"><img src="image57.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" 
						 border="0" /></p>
<p>This dialog allows you to quickly see the configuration of a node, such 
 as the references and any nested properties etc.</p>
<p>Note: along the top of the dialog you can use the simple navigation 
 tools to change the view to display the details of a different UA node.</p>
<h3>View Attributes</h3>
<p class="Picture"><img src="image58.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" 
						 border="0" /></p>
<p>This dialog displays the values for all attributes of the selected node.</p>
<h3>Read</h3>
<p>See <a href="Reading_Nodes.htm">Reading Nodes</a>.</p>
<h3>History Read</h3>
<p>Active only when history is available on a node. Not documented.</p>
<h3>Write</h3>
<p>See <a href="Writing_to_Nodes.htm">Writing to Nodes</a>.</p>
<h3>History Update</h3>
<p>Active only when history is available on the node and is marked as having 
 the ability to receive updates. Not documented.</p>
<h3>Subscribe</h3>
<p class="Picture"><img src="image59.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" 
						 border="0" /></p>
<p>Provides a sub-menu with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">New</span> 
 option, which will allow you to create a new subscription. See <a href="Subscriptions.htm">Subscriptions</a>.</p>
<p>As new subscriptions are created, they will be displayed at the bottom 
 of this context menu, meaning that this menu will grow and shrink as the 
 number of subscriptions changes.</p>
<h3>Refresh</h3>
<p>Resets the browser and re-initiates the browsing by starting at the 
 root node.</p>
