<p>The OPC Foundation is the world’s leading community for interoperability 
 solutions based on OPC communication specifications that deliver universal 
 connectivity. The mission of this community of vendors, end-users, integrators 
 and educators is to advance the development, adoption and certification 
 of OPC based products.</p>
<p>The OPC Foundation is a not-for-profit organization whose more than 
 400 members share the common goal of providing the infrastructure, specifications, 
 technology and processes to facilitate multivendor, multiplatform, secure 
 and reliable interoperability through the use of the OPC specifications. 
 The Foundation is the official source for the OPC Certification Program, 
 ensuring that OPC products plug-and-play in real-world application.</p>
<p>OPC members include technology providers, which develop OPC-compliant 
 products; end-user companies, which are consumers of OPC technology in 
 the form of OPC-compliant products; and non-voting members, which are 
 universities, government, research institutions, and non-profit organizations.</p>
<p>Other key stakeholders include related technology organizations with 
 which the OPC Foundation collaborates to develop compatible and complementary 
 specifications.</p>
<p>The key markets for OPC technology include: Industrial Automation, Building 
 Automation, Embedded Devices, Energy Management (Smart Grid), Manufacturing 
 Enterprise Management, and Cloud-based Computing.</p>
<p>The OPC Foundation provides the umbrella organization for global members 
 to cooperate in the development and adoption of OPC technology, including 
 OPC UA (Unified Architecture) and OPC Classic.</p>
<p>The OPC Foundation develops and maintains the OPC Certification Program 
 to ensure plug-and-play interoperability and minimize systems integration 
 costs when creating and deploying OPC-based products.</p>
