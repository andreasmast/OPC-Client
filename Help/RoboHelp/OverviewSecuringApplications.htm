<h1>Securing Applications Overview</h1>
<p>OPC UA requires all products to be identified by a secure digital signature 
 that uniquely identifies a specific product, to a specific computer. Each 
 application can then be configured with a &quot;trust list&quot; that 
 identifies other UA products that it will trust. When a UA Client connects 
 to a Server, the Server and Client will check each other's certificates 
 to make sure that they trust each other. Both products must trust each 
 other for a connection to be established.</p>
<p>When connecting a Client to a Server for the first time, typically the 
 connection will be rejected as both applications do not trust each other 
 - although some products may be configured to automatically trust new 
 connections. An administrator will typically modify the trust list of 
 the applications to make sure the Server trusts the Client, and the Client 
 trusts the Server.</p>
<p>There are 2 tutorials that will walk you through the configuration process:</p>
