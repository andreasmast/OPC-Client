	<li>Introduction<br />
	<br />
	The OPC Foundation is an international organization in which users, 
	 vendors and consortia cooperate to develop standards for multivendor, 
	 multiplatform, secure and reliable interoperability in industrial 
	 automation.<br />
	<br />
	As such, the OPC Foundation provides the OPC Foundation members with 
	 unique opportunities to use the Specifications, Technology and Certification 
	 required to develop and apply OPC-based products. This licensing strategy 
	 is in place to protect the OPC Foundation and its members by providing 
	 them the legal infrastructure necessary to build OPC-based products 
	 and bring them to market.<br />
